What is Defect Life Cycle?
Defect life cycle is a cycle which a defect goes through during its lifetime.
 It starts when defect is found and ends when a defect is closed, after ensuring itâ€™s not reproduced.
 Defect life cycle is related to the bug found during testing.
The defect life cycle can vary from organization to organization and also from project to project
 based on several factors like organization policy, software development model
 used (like Agile, Iterative), project timelines, team structure etc.
