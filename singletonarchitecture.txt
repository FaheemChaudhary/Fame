What is Singletonarchitecture?
The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. 
Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a
 single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB 
connection for every object may be costly. Similarly, there can be a single 
configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems
 instead of creating multiple managers.
Definition: 
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class
 to one object. 
We can create single object , we use reuse this object .
If the requirements of classes is same.We can create one instance and use Across all classes.
We save time by this.
different ways to acheive singleton architecture
by making instance object as static.
Eg webdriver object declare as static.
By making static variable , we can call in other classes.
Like school name will be same for all the classes.
