What is a Feature File in Cucumber?
A Feature File is an entry point to the Cucumber tests. This is a file where you will describe
 your tests in Descriptive language (Like English). It is an essential part of Cucumber, 
as it serves as an automation test script as well as live documents. A feature file can contain a scenario or 
can contain many scenarios in a single feature file but it usually contains a list of scenarios.

Feature: Defines what feature you will be testing in the tests below

Given: Tells the pre-condition of the test
