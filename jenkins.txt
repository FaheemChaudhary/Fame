How continuous integration is achieved in jenkins?
Continuous Integration is a process of integrating code changes 
from multiple developers in a single project many times. The software
 is tested immediately after a code commit. With each code commit, code 
is built and tested. If the test is passed, the build is tested for deployment.
 If the deployment is successful, the code is pushed to production.
*The code is built and test as soon as Developer commits code. 
Jenkin will build and test code many times during the day

*If the build is successful, then Jenkins will deploy the source into the 
test server and notifies the deployment team.

*If the build fails, then Jenkins will notify the errors to the developer team.
*The code is built immediately after any of the Developer commits.it's easy to
 detect whose code caused the built to fail
*Automated build and test process saving timing and reducing defects.
*The code is deployed after every successful build and test.
*The development cycle is fast. New features are more readily available to users. Increases profits.
